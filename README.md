# speakup
"SpeakUp" is an Android app that enables users with visual impairment to find the allergens present in a food. I have used voice recognition and voice-to-text features to extract the allergen matching the user's input.
This app is supportive for visually impaired people in that there won't be any need for them to press any button just voice control is enough for them to open the app and give the inputs.
